# PentaStagiu-JAVA
ABOUT THE PROGRAM

Java is the most popular programming language in use (TIOBE index) since itâ€™s the only language that works across all computer platforms (and Android mobile) without having to be recompiled (or edited) for each one. Code once, and the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) does all the dirty work - making sure your awesome new program runs smoothly on any platform whether you work with Windows, Mac, Linux or Android mobile.
