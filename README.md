ABOUT THE PROGRAM

Join Pentalog’s Java Remote Training Program

We are inviting you to join Pentalog’s Java remote training program and enjoy your Java software developer becoming. For around 12 weeks, we will guide you through 3 modules starting with best practices and extending it - code by code by code.

Java is the most popular programming language in use (TIOBE index) since it’s the only language that works across all computer platforms (and Android mobile) without having to be recompiled (or edited) for each one. Code once, and the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) does all the dirty work - making sure your awesome new program runs smoothly on any platform whether you work with Windows, Mac, Linux or Android mobile.

Why is this so great?

Not only does this multi-platform language save you countless hours in rewriting code - it allows you to make your software available for download and even for sale on every marketplace - reaching millions more potential users on desktop and mobile!
