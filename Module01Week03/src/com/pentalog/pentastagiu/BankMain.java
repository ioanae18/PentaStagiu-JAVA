/*
Create a console application from the following requirements:
A bank account from where someone has the option to withdraw and deposit money
Write information to the console each time someone makes an operation on that account
Take into consideration any validations that have to be done since this is a debit account, so user canâ€™t withdraw more than he has into
account. Display this information to inform the user about why the operation failed
