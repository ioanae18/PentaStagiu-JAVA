Create a java application that facilitates the management of an airport. We should be able to view flights, register users to
flights and also ensure a plane capacity.

The application should provide methods for implementing the following functions

Add / Remove / Read flights (validate for duplicate flight number)
Add / Remove / Read users	(validate for duplicate user)
Add / Remove / Read users to a flight user list (validate max user capacity per plane, validate duplicate user)
How many / what flights did a user joined
How many / what destinations did a user visited
How many / what are the flights scheduled in the future
How many / what are the flights that already landed at destination (we assume no delay)
Update flight status based on departure date / flight duration
